## Philosophy

Most engineers look at tools and systems like Redis, Git, Docker, SQLite, Kafka, or production-grade HTTP servers and think,  
"Someone way smarter than me must have built this."

But that’s not how most things are made.  
They’re not born fully formed — they start small, broken, misunderstood.  
And they require dedicated, hungry engineers to keep them going.

The ones who assume these systems are beyond their comprehension  
will never fully understand how anything works.

So that’s what this blog is:  
My journey toward mastery — building the things I use from scratch,  
bit by bit, until nothing feels like magic.
